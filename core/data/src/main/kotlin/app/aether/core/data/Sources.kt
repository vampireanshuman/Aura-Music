/**
 * The sources AETHER knows, routed by id: `ytm:…` goes to YouTube Music, `local:…` to the phone.
 * [primary] fills Home, Explore and search. Screens never hold a source themselves.
 *
 * For listening, the listener's own sources ([CopySource]: the addons they added) are asked first for
 * an exact copy of a song from another source (architecture.md §4, PODIUM's preferred sources): all of
 * them together within [COPY_BUDGET_MS], in the listener's order; the first copy found plays in the
 * song's place, and stays chosen for as long as the song plays, so its every read is the same file.
 * When none has it, the song's own source plays it as ever. When they're slow, the song begins from its
 * own source and the search goes on: a copy that turns up is offered to the player ([lateCopies]), which
 * carries the song over to it mid-song (PODIUM's D-92), and is the song's copy from its next play. A
 * song kept on the phone is always its own source's audio.
