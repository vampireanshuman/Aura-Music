/*
 * Verse: the song as a page that's sung, as BitChord sings it (after am-lyrics, Apple Music's): every
 * line in the book serif at its heaviest, the line being sung bright and the rest a step back and a
 * little out of focus; each word lights as it's sung behind a soft leading edge, syllable by syllable
 * where the library times them, and lifts a hair off the line as it lands; a held note swells letter
 * by letter and gives off light. The answering vocal opens beneath its line only while it's sung, a
 * duet's second voice from the other side, Latin letters beneath a line in another script. Between
 * verses three points count the break out. The page moves a beat ahead of the singing, the lines after
 * the one it's moving to arriving a breath behind one another; touch a line to go to it, or turn the
 * page by hand, and it finds its place again once let be.
